# Recommendations for kohonen code
1. Vectorize the code
2. Add tests to the code. The test I did was a simple test for what I could calculate off the top of my head. 
I would love to see more tests that are more robust.
3. Change variable names to not be using lettering that is not on a standard keyboard
4. Break the code into easier to understand functions
5. Add formatting and linting to the code

I would also love:
* Use classes and use standard class methods for ML models to make the code a little more plug and play
